Date: 2021-01-21

    - When entering a string in the station search field all stations that are displayed in
      the "..." (all) category are searched.
    - A per-player mod setting now allows to ignore icon item names when searching. As my feeling
      is that this is what most players want it is activated by default initially.
    - A per-player mod setting enables that when entering a dot "." in the search field then the
      train is sent to the top station in the list. This option is disabled by default.
